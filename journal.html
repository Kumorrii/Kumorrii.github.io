			It's been a couple of days but finding motivation while nearly suffocating from the summer heat is challenging, but at the very least I feel like I am able to regain most of the knowledge I thought I had lost. Programming is like riding a bike, you never forget it (hopefully).
			Anyways, here we go again. The task I'm giving to myself is FizzBuzz, if I can't do this, then I don't even.
			<pre style="font-size: .5vw;">
		
	def FizzBuzz():
		'''Print out 1 to 100 but every multiple of 3 print Fizz, and every multiple of 5 print Buzz'''
				
		for num in range(101):
			if(num%3 == 0 and num%5 == 0):
				print("FizzBuzz")
						
			elif(num%3 == 0):
				print("Fizz")
					
			elif(num%5 == 0):
				print("Buzz")
						
			else:
				print(num)
			
			</pre>
			
			Well at the very least I can acknowledge that there is still some semblance of muscle memory within me. It's a weird feeling of going back to something familiar and all of a sudden your fingers just type out a function or certain syntax that haven't been dusted off in awhile. At the very least, being able to still code like this is somewhat reassuring. </br></br>
			Now it's time to dabble with lists just to further familiarize myself with all the basics: </br></br>
			
			<b>Unordered Lists:</b>
			<ul type = "circle">
				<li>Thing 1</li>
				<li>Thing 2</li>
				<li>Thing 3</li>
				<li>Thing 4</li>
				<li>Thing 5</li>
				
			</ul>
			
			<b>Ordered Lists:</b>
			<ol type = "1">
				<li>Stop</li>
				<li>Drop</li>
				<li>and Roll</li>
			</ol>
			
			<b>Definition Lists:</b>
			<dl>
				<dt><u>Rectangle</u></dt>
				<dd>An elongated square.</dd>
				
				<dt><u>Square</u></dt>
				<dd>A compressed rectangle.</dd>
			
			</dl>
			
			</br>
			
			I'll have to run through the tutorial again and see if I haven't practiced anything that might seem relevant or important. But there is a lot to this tutorial that seems incredibly dated, probably won't be applicable in the year 2021 at the very least. Honestly, most of these HTML basics are for like super dated mid-2000s homepages with tacky decorations assaulting your vision.

		    Learning HTML is a trial by fire, so I should try and take things one step at a time. <br/>
			
			<pre style="font-size: .5vw;">
			
	void DoingThingsTheHardWay(random_object thing1, random_object thing2){
		random_object temp;
		random_object* thing1_adr;
		random_object* thing2_adr;
				
		thing1_adr = &thing1;
		thing2_adr = &thing2;
				
		temp = *thing1_adr;
		*thing1_adr = *thing2_adr;
		*thing2_adr = temp;
				
		return 0;
	}

			Practicing my rusty programming skills, hopefully I haven't completely forgotten everything. At the very least, I feel as if it has been ingrained into my memory just like learning a bike, despite me never having actually learned how to bike. But this is also to test the preserve programming tag, which gives me some freedom like the ASCII art in the homepage. <br /><br />
			And to test both align and title at the same time, it would be something like this: <br />
			
			<p align = "left" title = "Completely">This</p>
			<p align = "center" title = "pointless">seems</p>
			<p align = "right" title = "though.">correct.</p> 
			
			<br /><br />
			<p>And for the following sentence, it should be a pain to read:</p>
			<p><code>Do</code> <b>your</b> <i>eyes</i> <u>hurt</u> <mark>by</mark> <strike>just</strike> <tt>looking</tt> <sup>at</sup> <sub>something</sub> <big>like</big> <small>this?</small></p>
			<p> Just doing it once is good enough to keep note of it and shove it away somewhere within the many bytes inside my brain. Just writing code is better than nothing. </p><br />
