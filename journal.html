			Practicing my rusty programming skills, hopefully I haven't completely forgotten everything. At the very least, I feel as if it has been ingrained into my memory just like learning a bike, despite me never having actually learned how to bike. But this is also to test the preserve programming tag, which gives me some freedom like the ASCII art in the homepage. <br /><br />
			And to test both align and title at the same time, it would be something like this: <br />
			
			<p align = "left" title = "Completely">This</p>
			<p align = "center" title = "pointless">seems</p>
			<p align = "right" title = "though.">correct.</p> 
			
			<br /><br />
			<p>And for the following sentence, it should be a pain to read:</p>
			<p><code>Do</code> <b>your</b> <i>eyes</i> <u>hurt</u> <mark>by</mark> <strike>just</strike> <tt>looking</tt> <sup>at</sup> <sub>something</sub> <big>like</big> <small>this?</small></p>
			<p> Just doing it once is good enough to keep note of it and shove it away somewhere within the many bytes inside my brain. Just writing code is better than nothing. </p><br />
